Implementation:

      All elements have been correctly implemented including open/close tags, not using "style" in html, including and formatting css files, and using and naming classes.
      
Collaboration:

      Worked with several peers on various styling ideas, debugging, and critiquing:
            -Michael Seltzer
            -Jackson Clawson
            -Danielle Zelin
            -Zach Kirsch

      Hours of work indirectly related to this project: 8 hours
            Completed the html/css course on codecademy.com
            
Layout of website:

      Three pages total:
            -Index (home)
            -bio.html (about)
            -resume.html (resume)
            
      Using several divs, the content was separated and organized. A header was fixed to the top of each webpage for easy access to all pages in the site. The text size and background change depending on which page the user is on. 
      
      Problems:
      
            - Header doesn't stay in the same place, nor does the menu text placement. 
            - when I delete some text in the header, the whole thing is removed
