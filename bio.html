    <h1> This is Dan! </h1>
      <p>Dan is a sophomore at Tufts University studying Human Factors Engineering. He chose this path so he could pursue a broader range of subjects including psychology, design, and computer science. One day he hopes to work with a team of engineers designing products or overseeing larger industrial projects. Dan's passion and experience with leadership training and team building go hand in hand with the career path he has set out on. As a Head Team Advisor with the National Student Leadership Conference, he became familiar with the difficulties that come with building an effective team dynamic and the techniques with which to improve it. This position also provided Dan an opportunity to work with a professional leadership coordinator to manage the personality traits that work against a cohesive team environment and refine his leadership style to accommodate for all types of people. </p>
